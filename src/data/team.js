      descr: "I am a burgeoning software developer who is growing in experience and understanding with the hopes that I can produce apps and software, whether it be for helping people to engage with one another, improve themselves, or share their own projects and endeavors. Coding has been an avid interest of mine since I was first introduced to it in 6th Grade, and since then I have largely taught myself to an intermediate level with Java, Javascript, and Python. Above all else though, I am a creative person, with interests in music and storytelling. I see myself as resourceful enough to be able to pursue any of these dreams and serve as an exemplar for others who would like to do the same.",

I decided to become a fellow because I simply wanted a direct path to becoming a full stack software engineer.  My interest in technology started from playing video games and researching who the developers were. Gaming has been a interest since I was young. As I grow I wanted to dissect games to see why they work the way they do.I am a quick learner and I work well with others. I value hard work and being an asset and not a liability to my team.",
